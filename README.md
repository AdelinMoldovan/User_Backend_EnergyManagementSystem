# User_Backend_EnergyManagementSystem

The system can be
accessed by two types of users after a login process: administrator (manager), and clients. The
administrator can perform CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations on user accounts
(defined by ID, name, role: admin/client).
All microservices, including the frontend, were deployed and run from Docker.
